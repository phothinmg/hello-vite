# Hello Vite with Preact


### About

This is an ongoing project created by beginner as a blog template using Vite and Preact. This project was born out of my passion for Vite and my desire to create an intuitive and easy-to-use template for beginner who want to use Vite and Preact in their projects.

One of the things that sets hello-vite apart from the project, it's playground for beginner to use Vite and Preact. These cutting-edge technologies allow for lightning-fast page load times and a seamless user experience, making it the perfect choice. 

### Project Name 

Inspired by 'hello-world', upcoming will be Vite-foo and Vite-bar.
